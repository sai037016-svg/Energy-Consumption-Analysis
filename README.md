# Energy Consumption Analysis – SQL Data Analytics Project:
# Project Overview:

This project focuses on analyzing energy consumption data using SQL to identify usage trends, regional performance patterns, and efficiency indicators. The objective is to transform raw energy data into meaningful insights that support operational efficiency, resource optimization, and strategic decision-making.

# Business Objective:

Energy consumption varies across regions, time periods, and sectors. This project aims to:

Identify trends in energy usage over time

Compare regional or categorical consumption patterns

Detect high-consumption areas requiring optimization

Support data-driven energy management strategies

# Approach & Methodology:

Structured and explored raw energy consumption data

Wrote optimized SQL queries for data extraction and aggregation

Applied grouping, filtering, and subqueries to analyze trends

Calculated key metrics such as total consumption, averages, and growth patterns

Interpreted results to derive actionable business insights

# Skills Demonstrated:

Advanced SQL querying (GROUP BY, JOINs, Subqueries, Aggregations)

Data analysis and trend identification

Analytical problem-solving

Business insight generation

Structured reporting and interpretation

# Tools & Technologies Used:

SQL (MySQL / Relational Database)

Data querying and aggregation techniques

Presentation tools for reporting insights

# Key Insights:

Identified peak energy consumption periods

Highlighted regional variations in usage patterns

Detected areas with consistently high consumption

Provided recommendations for improved energy efficiency

# Outcome:

This project demonstrates strong SQL proficiency and the ability to convert structured data into actionable business insights. It highlights analytical thinking, problem-solving capability, and effective communication of data findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
